  <h1>Congress refuses to fix healthcare.<br>We’re forcing them — or replacing them.</h1>
  <p>
    PHIERS is a coordinated, district-level pressure movement using existing law and telehealth
    to make basic care affordable for everyone — fast. No new taxes. No new legislation.
    Just using the tools Congress already gave themselves and never finished.
  </p>

  <p class="subtle" style="margin-top:0.75rem;">
    This is not a company. Not a product. Not a donation funnel. It’s a coordination signal.
  </p>
</header>

<section id="problem">
  <h2>Healthcare is collapsing. The money is already there.</h2>
  <p>
    We spend over <strong>$10,000 per person per year</strong> on “healthcare” in the U.S.
    Most of it never reaches actual care. It disappears into admin, billing games, and
    insurance overhead — while people skip basic treatment, drown in debt, or die waiting.
  </p>

  <div class="math">
    <strong>The leverage Congress won’t talk about:</strong>
    <p>
      With existing ACA authority and modern telehealth, we can deliver a basic care floor
      for about <strong>$600 per person per year</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s enough to cover primary care, mental health, and chronic care management for
      roughly <strong>80% of Americans</strong> — without new taxes and without killing
      private insurance.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    The problem isn’t that we don’t have the money. The problem is that Congress refuses
    to re-aim it. PHIERS is the plan to force that re-aiming — or replace the people blocking it.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="why-this-works">
  <h2>Why this can actually work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>3.5% rule:</strong> History shows that when ~3.5% of people actively engage, systems change.</li>
    <li><strong>District-level pressure:</strong> Members of Congress don’t fear “the nation.” They fear their own district.</li>
    <li><strong>Replacement threat:</strong> When enough voters in a district coordinate around a single demand, incumbents move — or lose.</li>
    <li><strong>Existing law:</strong> We’re not waiting for a miracle bill. We’re using authority that already exists.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Our target:</strong>
    <p>
      Reach the 3.5% engagement threshold in enough districts to force a national realignment
      on healthcare by <strong>July 4, 2026</strong> — or send a wave of replacements to Congress
      who will finish the job.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    We are not asking you to “believe” in a fantasy. We are asking you to help apply
    the minimum force required to make Congress do the job they already owe us.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="petition">
  <h2>What signing the PHIERS petition actually does</h2>
  <p>
    Your signature is not a “like.” It’s a <strong>coordination signal</strong> that lets us
    map where pressure already exists — district by district — and where we need to grow.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> You sign with your district information.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Your district is added to the PHIERS pressure map.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> When enough people in your district sign, we trigger a local escalation:
      coordinated calls, media pressure, and candidate commitments.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> If your member of Congress refuses to move, we help recruit and support
      a replacement who will.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="how-it-works">
  <h2>Want proof this isn’t just vibes?</h2>
  <p>
    We’ve mapped the legal authority, the telehealth math, and the district-level strategy into
    a concrete plan. If you’re the kind of person who needs to see the receipts before you move,
    that’s exactly who we built this for.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The legal grounding:</strong> How existing ACA authority and waivers can fund a $600 floor.</li>
    <li><strong>The telehealth cascade:</strong> How one conversion can fund many more, creating exponential coverage.</li>
    <li><strong>The district strategy:</strong> How we turn signatures into real pressure and replacement threats.</li>
    <li><strong>The 90-day sprints:</strong> How we move from “idea” to “they can’t ignore us” in cycles.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="identity">
  <h2>Who we are (and who we’re not)</h2>
  <p>
    PHIERS stands for <strong>Make America Better and Healthier</strong>. It’s a public-interest
    movement built by people who are done watching friends, family, and neighbors get wrecked
    by a system that already has the money to fix this.
  </p>

  <p class="teeth">We are the TEETH.</p>
  <p>
    That means we are not here to “raise awareness” and go home. We are here to bite down on
    a single, winnable demand — and not let go until Congress either does it, or gets replaced
    by people who will.
