# PHIERS Movement Website

PHIERS — Make America Better And Healthier (MABAH)

This repository contains the official movement site for PHIERS, a public-interest citizen movement focused on structural healthcare reform.

This is not a startup site.  
This is not a marketing funnel.  
This is not a product landing page.

This is movement infrastructure.

## Development Philosophy

You are implementing a movement architecture.

Your role is to make the existing message:

• Clearer  
• More stable  
• More accessible  
• More technically reliable  

Never more “marketable.”

When in doubt:

Preserve the copy.  
Preserve the hierarchy.  
Preserve the structure.  
Do less, not more.

---

## Technical Expectations

• Use relative paths  
• Maintain consistent layout  
• Verify responsiveness  
• Verify link integrity  
• Avoid risky global search/replace  

### Encoding & Professional Integrity

All files must use UTF-8 encoding.

Mojibake (garbled characters) is unacceptable.

Before merging:

• Verify GitHub preview  
• Verify live GitHub Pages rendering  

PHIERS must present as stable civic infrastructure.
